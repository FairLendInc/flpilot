# Comprehensive Site Map and Workflow Documentation

I'll create a detailed markdown document that explains every page, component, workflow, and architectural pattern in the FairLend application. This will include:

1. **Project Overview & Architecture**
   - Tech stack (Next.js, Convex, WorkOS AuthKit, Tailwind CSS)
   - Authentication flow with WorkOS
   - Role-based access control system

2. **Complete Page Structure**
   - Public pages (home, sign-in, callback)
   - Authenticated route groups (dashboard, listings, profile)
   - Role-specific dashboards (admin, broker, lawyer, investor)
   - Detail pages and modals

3. **Component Architecture**
   - Layout components (sidebar, navigation, providers)
   - Business components (listings, cards, filters)
   - UI components and their purposes

4. **Workflows & User Journeys**
   - Authentication flow
   - Role switching mechanism
   - Listing browsing and filtering
   - Dashboard interactions per role

5. **Data Models & Convex Schema**
   - User, roles, organizations
   - Relationships and indexing

6. **Development Setup & Configuration**
   - Environment variables
   - Build and deployment commands
   - Testing setup

This documentation will be comprehensive enough for an AI agent to understand and recreate the entire application structure and functionality.
