# Investor Guide: How to Request Listing Locks

## Overview

As an investor, you can request to lock marketplace listings for your exclusive consideration. This guide explains how to submit lock requests and track their status.

## What is a Lock Request?

A **lock request** reserves a listing for your review and potential investment. When approved by an admin, the listing becomes locked to you, preventing other investors from requesting it.

## Prerequisites

- You must have an **investor** role in the system
- The listing must be **available** (not already locked or hidden)
- You need your lawyer's information ready:
  - Lawyer's full name
  - Lawyer's LSO (Law Society of Ontario) number
  - Lawyer's email address

## How to Submit a Lock Request

### Step 1: Find a Listing

1. Navigate to the **Listings** page from the main menu
2. Browse available investment properties
3. Click on a listing that interests you to view details

### Step 2: Check Listing Availability

Before requesting, verify:
- The listing shows **no "Locked" badge** (if you see a red "Locked" badge, it's already taken)
- The listing is visible and available
- You have investor access

### Step 3: Open the Request Dialog

1. On the listing detail page, find the **"Request to Lock Listing"** button
2. Click the button to open the lock request dialog

### Step 4: Fill Out the Request Form

The form requires:

#### Required Information

- **Lawyer Name** - Your lawyer's full name
- **Lawyer LSO Number** - Your lawyer's Law Society of Ontario registration number
- **Lawyer Email** - Your lawyer's professional email address (must be valid email format)

#### Optional Information

- **Request Notes** - Add any notes about your interest in the property
  - Maximum 1000 characters
  - Character counter shows remaining characters
  - Use this to explain your investment intent or ask questions

### Step 5: Submit Your Request

1. Review all information for accuracy
2. Click **"Submit Lock Request"**
3. You'll see a success message: "Lock request submitted. Admin will review."

## Tracking Your Request Status

### Viewing Request Status

After submission, you'll see your request status on the listing detail page:

- **"Request Pending"** - Your request is awaiting admin review
  - You can cancel the request if needed
  - Status updates in real-time

- **"Listing Locked by You"** - Your request was approved
  - The listing is now locked for your exclusive consideration
  - Other investors cannot request this listing

- **"Lock Request Rejected"** - Your request was denied
  - You'll see the rejection reason (if provided by admin)
  - You can request again if the listing becomes available

### Real-Time Updates

- Status updates automatically without refreshing the page
- You'll see changes immediately when an admin approves or rejects your request

## Cancelling a Pending Request

If you change your mind before admin review:

1. Go to the listing detail page
2. Find your pending request status
3. Click **"Cancel Request"**
4. Confirm cancellation in the dialog

**Note**: You can only cancel requests that are still pending. Once approved or rejected, you cannot cancel.

## Understanding Lock Status

### Available Listings

- Show no "Locked" badge
- Can be requested by any investor
- Multiple investors can request the same listing

### Locked Listings

- Show a red **"Locked"** badge
- Cannot be requested (button is hidden)
- Already reserved by another investor (or you, if you were approved)

## What Happens After Approval

When your request is approved:

1. **Listing is Locked**: The listing becomes exclusive to you
2. **Badge Appears**: A "Locked" badge appears on the listing card
3. **Other Requests**: Other investors' pending requests remain pending (they'll be rejected)
4. **Exclusive Access**: You have priority access to complete your investment

## Common Questions

### How long does approval take?

- Admins typically review requests within 24-48 hours
- You'll receive real-time updates when your request is reviewed

### Can I request multiple listings?

- Yes! You can submit requests for multiple listings simultaneously
- Each request is independent

### What if my request is rejected?

- See the [Troubleshooting Guide](./LOCK_REQUEST_TROUBLESHOOTING.md) for details
- Common reasons include:
  - Listing was already locked by another investor
  - Incomplete or invalid information
  - Listing is no longer available

### Can I edit my request after submitting?

- No, requests cannot be edited after submission
- If you need to change information, cancel the request and submit a new one

### What if I see an error when submitting?

- **"Listing is already locked"**: Another investor already has this listing locked
- **"Invalid lawyer email format"**: Check that the email address is properly formatted
- **"Notes too long"**: Reduce your notes to under 1000 characters
- **"Unauthorized"**: Ensure you have investor role access

## Best Practices

### Before Submitting

1. **Verify Listing Availability**: Check that the listing isn't already locked
2. **Prepare Lawyer Information**: Have all lawyer details ready before starting
3. **Review Listing Details**: Make sure the listing meets your investment criteria
4. **Write Clear Notes**: Use the notes field to explain your interest clearly

### After Submitting

1. **Monitor Status**: Check back regularly for status updates
2. **Be Patient**: Allow admins time to review (24-48 hours)
3. **Don't Duplicate**: Avoid submitting multiple requests for the same listing
4. **Cancel if Needed**: If you're no longer interested, cancel promptly
