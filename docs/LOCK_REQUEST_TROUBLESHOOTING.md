# Troubleshooting: What If My Request Is Rejected?

## Overview

If your lock request was rejected, this guide helps you understand why and what to do next.

## Understanding Rejection Reasons

When an admin rejects your request, they may provide a rejection reason. Common reasons include:

### Listing Already Locked

**Reason**: "Listing is already locked by another investor"

**What This Means**:
- Another investor's request was approved before yours
- The listing is now exclusive to that investor
- Your request was automatically rejected

**What You Can Do**:
- Look for other available listings
- Submit requests for multiple listings to increase your chances
- Check back later if the lock expires or is released

### Incomplete Information

**Reason**: "Missing or invalid lawyer information"

**What This Means**:
- Your lawyer's name, LSO number, or email was missing or incorrect
- The email format was invalid
- Required fields were not filled out

**What You Can Do**:
- Verify your lawyer's information is complete and accurate
- Ensure the email address is properly formatted (e.g., `lawyer@firm.com`)
- Double-check the LSO number is correct
- Submit a new request with corrected information

### Listing No Longer Available

**Reason**: "Listing is no longer available"

**What This Means**:
- The listing may have been removed from the marketplace
- The listing may have been sold or withdrawn
- The listing status changed after you submitted your request

**What You Can Do**:
- Check if the listing still appears in the marketplace
- Contact support if you believe this is an error
- Look for similar listings that meet your criteria

### Business Rules Violation

**Reason**: "Request does not meet business requirements"

**What This Means**:
- Your request may violate platform policies
- There may be restrictions based on your account status
- The listing may have specific eligibility requirements

**What You Can Do**:
- Review platform terms and conditions
- Contact support for clarification
- Ensure your account is in good standing

### No Reason Provided

**What This Means**:
- The admin rejected without providing a specific reason
- This is less helpful but still valid

**What You Can Do**:
- Review your request for any obvious issues
- Contact support for more information
- Submit a new request if the listing is still available

## Steps to Take After Rejection

### 1. Review the Rejection Reason

- Check the listing detail page for the rejection reason
- Read the message carefully to understand why it was rejected
- Look for specific issues mentioned

### 2. Address Any Issues

- **Incorrect Information**: Fix any errors in your request
- **Missing Information**: Complete any missing required fields
- **Format Issues**: Correct email format or other validation errors

### 3. Decide Your Next Steps

**Option A: Submit a New Request**
- If the listing is still available
- After fixing any issues with your original request
- Ensure all information is accurate

**Option B: Look for Other Listings**
- Browse other available properties
- Submit requests for multiple listings
- Don't focus on a single listing

**Option C: Contact Support**
- If you believe the rejection was in error
- If you need clarification on the reason
- If you have questions about the process
